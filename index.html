          <p>
            Since 2010 our founder, Laurel McLanahan, has worked diligently every holiday season to bring gifts of clothing, toys, money, and more to people in need. What started off as a friendly, kind-hearted gesture quickly grew into a small organization of friends and family. Each year, Laurel has gathered her small crew to help those in need get through the holiday season. Our goal is to provide a relief to those in need during stressful times so that they can focus on current hardships. As of 2025, over three dozen families have been supported through their holiday season with gifts of clothing, food, money, and more!

          <p>
            Known throughout his community for his kind heart and loving generosity, Carl Swanson II was a large part of Laurel’s annual operations, especially in later years. Prior to his passing in 2025, Carl spent years working side-by-side with Laurel as they spent countless hours gathering donations, hearing peoples’ stories, and helping out everywhere they could. Operating as a nameless collection of helpful people, it was in Carl’s passing that the organization finally had a name.... because even though his physical form has left us, any holiday filled with love, generosity, giving, and caring will always feel like Christmas At Carl’s.
